move the directory to inspect to your current path
$ mv ~/Desktop/coolbins ./coolbins

run gen_ftlists.sh on the dir
$ scripts/gen_ftlists.sh coolbins

find a type of files you would like to extract data from
for example "data"
run gen_bwlists.sh on the file type in the new "out" directory
$ scripts/gen_bwlists.sh out/data

run ext_bwlists.sh on out/data.bwlists to extract them now
$ ext_bwlists.sh out/data.bwlists

we now have out.ext with all of our extracted files

if you want, modify and run cleanup.sh on out.ext to clean unneeded subtypes of files
